# History

## This is a public repository of my current researching project. It is part of UC Berkeley's Department of History's One-year Track Thesis.

## The folders in the repository are as the following:
### codebook: the coding notebook that contains all the algorithm for the project. Could be opened in Jupyterhub or Jupypter Lab.
### 明实录: It has a full digital version of the 明实录 (Ming Shilu), with subcopies divided by emperors. All copies are of .txt format.
### country_names_明史: It is extracted from 明史 (Ming Shi) that has a list of foreign nations that the Ming has ever recognized.
### with_location: It is a .csv file with the name of each foreign states that have sent tributes or emissary to Ming, with their number of contacts, and geological locations.
