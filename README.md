# History

## This is a public repository of my current researching project. It is part of UC Berkeley's Department of History's One-year Track Thesis.
### *Please open the codebook.ipynb to see the step-by-step analysis.*
## The folders and files in the repository are as the following:
### codebook: the coding notebook that contains all the algorithm for the project. Could be opened in Jupyterhub or Jupypter Lab.
### 明实录 (Ming Shilu, or Veritable Records of Ming): It has a full digital version of the text, with subcopies divided by emperors. All copies are of .txt format.
### with_location: It is a .csv file with the name of each foreign states that have sent tributes or emissary to Ming, with their number of contacts, and geological locations.
### by_month_region_excel.xlsx: A spreadsheet with data of tribute missions grouped by regions and months.
